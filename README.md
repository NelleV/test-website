# HOW TO update stuff on our wonderful website

* Log into your github account and make sure the computer you are on has been listed through a ssh key
* Clone the repo:

`git clone git@github.com:TrEE-TIMC/tree-timc.github.io.git`


Now the fun can start!

NB: if you want to avoid to enter your SSH passphrase upon each action, you can used `ssh-add` once and for all on your computer.


So then the process is:
- make changes to the site
- push
- take a coffee!
- look at the webpage!


To be noted:
* Index page is HTML
* The rest are markdown pages
* Stored files are in the *files* folder
* Publications are automatically listed from the _publications folder via the publications.md file.
