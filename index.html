<h2>Welcome!</h2>


<p> The CompBio@TrEE  is the computational biology group of the <a
href="fixme">TrEE</a> team (<a href="https://www.timc.fr/en/tree">TIMC</a>) in Grenoble. Our research
is dedicated to the <b>development of methods</b> and tools to analyse,
interpret, and decipher biological data and process, with a focus on
<b>the evolution of prokaryotes.</b></p>

<p>We are composed of experts in <b>comparative genomics</b>, <b>machine
learning</b>, and <b>biophysics.</b></p>

<h2>Highlights</h2>

<ul>
<li>The 3D structure of genomes</li>
<li>Evolution of biosynthetic pathways</li>
<li>Evolution of complex cellular machineries</li>
<li>Development of methods to annotate genomes</li>
<li>Development of methods to analyse various omics data</li>

<li>and more...</li>
