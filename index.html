<h2>Welcome!</h2>


<p> The CompBio@TrEE  is the computational biology group of the <a
href="https://www.timc.fr/en/tree"">TrEE</a> team (<a href="https://www.timc.fr/en/">TIMC</a>) in Grenoble. Our research
is dedicated to the <b>development of methods</b> and tools to analyse,
interpret, and decipher biological data and process, with a focus on
<b>the evolution of prokaryotes.</b></p>

<p>We are composed of experts in <b>comparative genomics</b>, <b>machine
learning</b>, and <b>biophysics.</b></p>
