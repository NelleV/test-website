## Permanent staff

**Ivan Junier**


**Sophie Abby** received a bi-disciplinary education in biology and
computational sciences. She is an evolutionary biologist, particularly
interested in the mechanisms of diversification of prokaryotes (archaea and
bacteria). She studies these at different scales: from enzymes, to macromolecular
complexes, and genome dynamics with respect to environmental adaptations. When
needed, she designs new computational methods in the field of comparative
genomics and phylogenomics. 


[Nelle Varoquaux](https://nellev.github.io) is a machine.
